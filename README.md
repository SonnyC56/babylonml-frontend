# BabylonML Frontend Showcase

This repository hosts examples and showcases for the BabylonML library.

## What is BabylonML?

BabylonML is a declarative, markup-based framework (similar to A-Frame or HTML) for building 3D scenes using Babylon.js. It aims to simplify the process of creating and managing Babylon.js scenes by abstracting away boilerplate code and providing a component-based architecture.

**Core Goals:**

*   **Declarative Syntax:** Define scenes, entities, and components using an HTML-like markup language.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Attach reusable behaviors and properties (components) to entities.
*   **Extensibility:** Enable the creation and registration of custom components and primitives.
*   **Babylon.js Integration:** Leverage the power and features of the Babylon.js engine.
*   **Ease of Use:** Provide a simpler entry point for web developers.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains various HTML files demonstrating how to use BabylonML features. These examples load the BabylonML library directly from its distribution URL.
